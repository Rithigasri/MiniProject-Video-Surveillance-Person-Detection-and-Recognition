# VIDEO SURVEILLANCE PERSON DETECTION AND RECOGNITION

## ABSTRACT:
This project addresses a critical challenge in CCTV video surveillance: the need for automated person tagging and recognition. Conventional systems rely on manual efforts, leading to labor-intensive and error-prone processes. This project seeks to revolutionize video surveillance by using image processing techniques to automate person tagging and recognition, enhancing security and situational awareness.<br/>

By accurately tagging individuals, recognizing them and generating alerts, it empowers security professionals and emphasizes responsible surveillance practices. Through systematic data collection and advanced face detection and recognition techniques, this project lays the foundation for efficient and accurate video surveillance, promising improved security and responsive law enforcement.
